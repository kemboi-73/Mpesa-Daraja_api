## Getting Started

M-PESA integration with your Django project enables you to perform STK push transactions. This means your users can make payments directly from their mobile phones using the Safaricom M-PESA service.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this integration, ensure you have the following in place:

- A Django project.
- Access to Safaricom's M-PESA API. You'll need the necessary credentials (Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, etc.) for authentication.
- Familiarity with Django and Python programming.
- A working understanding of the M-PESA API.

## Installation

To integrate M-PESA with your Django project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your Django project directory.

2. Ensure you have the necessary credentials from Safaricom to access their API. Update the code with your credentials where necessary.

3. Make sure you have the required libraries installed. If not, you can install them using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

4. Update the `callback_url` to point to your actual callback URL where you want to receive transaction notifications.

5. You can customize the STK push payload to suit your specific use case.

## Usage

The integration provides a Django view function named `initiate_stk_push` that you can use to initiate an STK push transaction. You can invoke this view in your Django application, and it will initiate the M-PESA transaction for you.

Here's a brief overview of the code:

- It obtains an access token from M-PESA using the `get_access_token` function.
- It assembles the STK push payload with relevant details such as business short code, password, timestamp, etc.
- It sends the STK push request to M-PESA using the `requests` library.
- It handles the response and provides feedback accordingly.

You can customize the function according to your project's requirements.
